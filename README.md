# Job Tracking Tool

This is a job tracking tool developed for personal use.
I am using it for my Spring 2021 Co-op search and will plan on 
updating it as needed during my use of it.


It currently is a form of data entry to a .csv file, but I 
hope to eventually add support for viewing the jobs in the app.
